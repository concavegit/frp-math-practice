* Mental Math
[[file:sample.png]]

A repository for me to practice FRP and mental math.
At the moment only multiplication is implemented.

* Gameplay
You have 90 seconds to answer as many 2-digit multiplication problems as possible.
A correct answer is 1 point, and an incorrect answer is -1 points.
To discourage shying away from unfavorable odds, one can only restart once the 90 seconds is up.

* Installing
1. If not done already, [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][install the git command line]].
2. If not done already, [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/][install stack]].
3. Open the git command line.
4. Run `git clone https://gitlab.com/concavegit/mental-math.git`
5. Run `cd mental-math`
6. Run `stack install`
7. To play, type `mental-math-exe`
